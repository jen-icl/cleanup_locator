48 hour Hackathon project aimed to combine different data sources into an application

This application is designed to create a platform for users to find out more about the detrimental effects of plastic pollution and connect to public events calling for volunteers to help cleanup local communities

### App Features
- A map displaying worldwide clean up events
    - Map contains location search and geolocation features
- Each map marker contains information about the clean up event
    - A link to the event website
    - Weather data of the event location
    - Event sharing features via facebook and twitter
- A running headline of recent news articles related to "Plastic Pollution"

### Accomplishments
- Technologies used:
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Bootstrap4
- APIs used:

### Requirements
- Combine at least 4 **external** resources via AJAX requests and present the returned information in an application
- Must be documented loosely on JSDOC standards
- All API interactions must be encapsulated in an OOP object defined with a class
    - must use class
    - must have methods to access the data
    - must pass data to subsequent functions with callbacks upon getting data
- Must be issue-managed via meistertask or trello

### Judging Criteria
- **Appeal**: is it visually appealing / well put together
- **Code Quality**: is the code properly formatted, are variables and functions well defined and documented
- **Presentation**: How well is it presented during the unveiling session
- **Task / Issue Management**: How well was the development process documented / controlled.  Were there well-defined issues, milestones, and project management
- **Innovative / Transformative**: Did the project do something new and exciting?  Was it bold and tried to do things that haven't been done much.  Did it combine the data sources together in a way that was more useful than either source by itself
- **Ease of Use / Understanding**: Was it easy to use the application / game, or if it was more complex, was the application or game able to provide you with tutorials or instructions that made understanding it a breeze.
